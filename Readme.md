Here are some guides intended for BEGINNERS so that they can execute any given task easily.

After using these guides enough times, the person should be able to develop his/her own ways of doing these or similar tasks.

For the time being, only Javascript tasks are available.

You are welcome to contribute by suggesting what should be improved and be adding new tasks.
